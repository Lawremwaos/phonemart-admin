## 📝 What You Need To Do:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if needed)
- Go to: https://github.com/signup
- Sign up (it's free!)

### Step 2: Create New Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `phonemart-admin` (or any name)
   - Description: "PHONEMART Admin System" (optional)
   - Choose: **Public** or **Private**

3. **IMPORTANT:** 
   - ❌ Do NOT check "Add a README file"
   - ❌ Do NOT check "Add .gitignore" 
   - ❌ Do NOT choose a license
   - Just leave everything unchecked!

4. **Click:** Green "Create repository" button

### Step 3: Copy the Repository URL

After clicking "Create repository", you'll see a page with a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phonemart-admin.git
```

**Copy this entire URL** (including https://)

### Step 4: Tell Me Your Repository URL

Just reply with:
- Your GitHub repository URL

**OR** if you want to do it yourself, run these commands:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Eviel\Desktop\Admin\PHONEMART_FRONTEND
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

(Replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE` with the URL you copied)
