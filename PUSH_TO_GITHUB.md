## Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to: https://github.com/signup
2. Enter your email, create a password
3. Verify your email

2. Repository name: `phonemart-admin` (or any name you like)
3. Description (optional): "PHONEMART Admin Management System"
4. Choose: **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
